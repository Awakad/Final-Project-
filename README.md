## The Team 

- Deng T.Deng
- Callistus Ikeata
- Carter Richards
- Rojin Shahba

## Project Overview

Project topic is Predicting Movie Revenues

## Reason For The Project Topic

In a world, where movies made an estimated of over $41.7 billion in 2018 , the film industry is more popular than ever. But what movies make the most money and what are the factor responsible for this ? How much does a director matter? Or the budget? Or the actor?

## Data Source: 
[Box Office Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/c/tmdb-box-office-prediction/data?select=sample_submission.csv) [IMDB database](https://www.kaggle.com/carolzhangdc/imdb-5000-movie-dataset)

## Machine Learning Model

The dataset is available in a csv file. We will develop a Regression model for predicting movie revenue for 5000 movie dataset.

We will performed data analysis, feature extraction, cleaning, preprocessing and train the model.

We will analyze the model's accuracy by plotting the result, and take into account our errors.

Libraries to be used includes python and scikit-learn to present the machine learning model.

## Communication Protocols and Roles

Rojin - handled the ERD and database mockup for the dataset. In addition, Rojin helped with the organisation and co-ordination of the group.

Deng - handled the project repository and maintained it for the whole week. 

Callistus - handled data cleaning and machine learning portion, we will run a regression model. The dataset will first be preprocessed to be used in our models.

Carter - Contributed in finding a situatable project topic.

The role of each team member in our group will change every week to ensure everyone can experience different aspects of the project and provide their valuable input. We created a slack channel  dedicated for all project related communications, resources, updates, and Q&A. A weekly touchpoint has been scheduled in addition to the regular class sessions to ensure all team members are confident in the final deliverables and feel supported throughout the project.
