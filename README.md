## Project Overview

Project topic is Predicting Movie Revenues

## Reason For The Project Topic

In a world, where movies made an estimated of over $41.7 billion in 2018 , the film industry is more popular than ever. But what movies make the most money and what are the factor responsible for this ? How much does a director matter? Or the budget? Or the actor?

## Data Source: 
[Box Office Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/c/tmdb-box-office-prediction/data?select=sample_submission.csv) [IMDB database](https://www.kaggle.com/carolzhangdc/imdb-5000-movie-dataset)

## Machine Learning Model

The dataset is available in a csv file. We will develop a Regression model for predicting movie revenue for 5000 movie dataset.

We will performed data analysis, feature extraction, cleaning, preprocessing and train the model.

We will analyze the model's accuracy by plotting the result, and take into account our errors.

Libraries to be used includes python and scikit-learn to present the machine learning model.
